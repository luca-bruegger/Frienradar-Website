Welcome to the Frienradar App!

The Frienradar app offers you an easy way to find and connect with new friends in your area. Here is a quick guide on how to use the app:

## Registration:
Download the Frienradar app from the App Store or Google Play.
Open the app and create an account by entering your email address and a password.
Enter your profile information, such as your name. You can also add a profile picture to give other users a first impression of you.

## Location sharing:
Allow the app to access your location so it can find users near you.
You can change location sharing at any time in the app settings.

## Discover:
After you sign in and location sharing is enabled, you can use the app to discover other users in your area.
The app will show you profiles of other users who are near you and may have similar interests.

## Connect:
If you like a user's profile, you can connect by tapping the "Request" button.
If the other user also accepts your connection, a notification will be displayed and you can network with each other.

## Profile management:
You can edit and update your own profile by navigating to the "Profile" button in the app.
Add information, change your profile picture, or update your description to show other users more about yourself.
Please note that the Frienradar app does not offer a chat feature or real-time communication. The main goal of the app is to help you find new friends in your area. However, once you connect, you can use other communication methods outside the app, such as exchanging phone numbers or social media.

We hope you have fun and successful connections with the Frienradar app!
